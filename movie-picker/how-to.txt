How to Use the Movie Details Script

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

To use the Movie Details script, you need to install the following libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running the above commands.

Step 2: Prepare the Movie List

Create a text file named movie_list.txt in the same directory as the script. List the movie titles, each on a separate line. For example:

Copy code
Die Hard
Inception
The Dark Knight

Feel free to add or remove movies from the list.

Step 3: Run the Script

Execute the script using Python. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run the following command:

Copy code
python ibm.py
The script will randomly select a movie from the movie_list.txt file, fetch its details from the OMDB API, and display the title, actor, description, and poster image. The poster image will also be saved to your desktop.

Save the above text in a file named how_to_use.txt or any other suitable name. It provides instructions on installing the required libraries and using the script along with the movie list.
